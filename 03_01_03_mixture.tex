It is possible to combine those two methods. For Named Entity, to avoid the problem of OOV, use the Bag of Words approach and use BERT for Keywords. After this processing, there will be two kinds of embedding vectors. Concatenate those two embedding vectors and set this vector as representing vector of an article. In this process, because the difference between those two vectors(one from Named Entity and the other one from Keywords) can cause a bias, normalize the former vector.
