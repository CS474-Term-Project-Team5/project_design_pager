 We will use the result of First Clustering process in this task. The degree of association between two distinct issues will be calculated by the distance between the embeddings. The 'related issue events' of an issue would be the events that are extracted through topic modelling from the closely associated issues. These events can be printed in order of its frequency in the cluster; the number of articles within the cluster that contains the event.\\
 The named entity informations identified from previous tasks will come in handy for the detailed analysis of each event.
