There are a variety of methods for searching the keywords such as Term Frequency, TF-IDF(statistical methods), pre-trained Worde Embedding, BERT and SOTA(language model). Team5 will try various kinds of methods and choose the optimal way among them.\\
In Keyword Extraction, rather than using body of the dataset, title and description will be used. Because the size of body is too large, it seems to be hard to extract meaningful, optimal keywords for clustering. Otherwise, it seems to be easier to extract keyword in title and description which are likely to have more summarized critical words.
